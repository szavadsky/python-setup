"""Stub for :mod:`python_setup_lint.runner.baseline`.

Drift-resistant baseline capture + diff with silent shrinkage (T2).
Additions ONLY are flagged as regressions; removals rewrite the baseline
in-place.  New entries use the schema-v2 ``records`` form (order-tolerant
sorted record list, multiset-accurate).  Legacy ``output``-string entries
load on read and are upgraded in-memory when a per-tool records parser
exists; tools without a parser keep the legacy rstrip-set path (recorded
in ``decisions.md`` per fallback).
